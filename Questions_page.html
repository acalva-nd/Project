         <h1>What is the frequency of different types of crimes in the  US? (Figure 6)</h1>
         <iframe src="crimes-us.html" width="1000" height="700"></iframe>
         <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;">Based on the data from the 48 states, larceny emerges as the most frequent type of crime, accounting for more than 50% of all reported offenses. This is notable since larceny is a non-violent crime, typically involving acts like pickpocketing or shoplifting. Its prevalence aligns with the high volume of theft-related incidents often highlighted in news reports.Following larceny, burglaries are the second most common type of crime. Unlike larceny, burglary involves unlawful entry and can encompass not only theft but also crimes like vandalism.Murders, on the other hand, make up the smallest proportion of reported crimes. While murder is often perceived as the most severe and attention-grabbing crime, it accounts for the lowest percentage of overall offenses. Despite its rarity, murder dominates media coverage, which may amplify public fear and create the perception that it is a more widespread issue than it actually is.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;">Another way to visualize these crimes is through maps. For this reason, we created choropleth maps for each individual crime to observe their distribution by state relative to the population. As seen in the pie chart, larcenies are the most frequent crime, and the map shows that they have the widest range, appearing more uniform across the country. The states affected by larcenies are shaded in similar shades of purple, indicating a consistent prevalence. This visualization could be useful for individuals who are considering crime rates when deciding where to move or invest in property, as it helps identify states with higher or lower crime rates of specific interest. </p>

         <h1>How do crime rates for various types of crimes differ between Northern and Southern states? (Figure 15)</h1>
         <iframe src="crimes_n-vs-n.html" width="1000" height="700"></iframe>
         <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;">To answer this question, we grouped our data by region, categorizing states into Southern and Northern regions. The Southern states include Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Oklahoma. The Northern states encompass both Northeastern and Midwestern states, including Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin Itâ€™s important to note that there are more Northern states represented than Southern states, which may influence the data. Despite this, we observe that nonviolent crimes are the most frequent across both regions. Interestingly, although the Northern region appears to dominate in terms of crime frequency, the Southern region shows higher rates of  murders, rapes, assaults, and burglaries. This suggests that the Southern states experience a higher incidence of violent crime, which aligns with the data.</p>

         <h1> What is the relationship between overall poverty levels and the frequency of the least common crime (murder) compared to the most common crime (larceny)?</h1>
         <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;">This graph compares the relationship between total poverty and the least and most frequently committed crimes in the Southern and Northern regions of the United States. From Figure 5, we know that the Northern region experiences higher levels of poverty. Although the sizes of the bubbles in the graph represent the population size of each region, this is not the most critical takeaway from the data. We chose to analyze the least and most frequently committed crimes to identify any potential differences, and the results reveal clear distinctions. For murder, there appears to be little to no correlation between total poverty and the number of murders. This is evident because Southern regions, which have less poverty, experience more murders, while Northern regions, despite having higher poverty levels, have lower murder rates.On the right side of the graph, focusing on larcenies, the most frequently committed crime in the U.S., a positive correlation between poverty and larcenies is evident. While poverty may not be the sole factor influencing larceny rates, this relationship highlights the importance of external factors that contribute to such crimes.</p>
