             <p>
                For our project, we selected a dataset from Kaggle that includes 2,018 unique entries and 146 columns. Among the multiple columns, we decided to focus on the crime rates across various states, aiming to uncover any significant patterns through visual analysis that could address our key questions. The dataset represents different communities within each state, providing valuable insights into regional crime trends.
             </p>
            <h2 class="text-muted">Who Would Benefit from Our Findings</h2>
            <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
               <li><strong>Individuals considering relocation:</strong> Our findings would be particularly valuable for those for whom crime rates play a critical role in their decision-making process.</li>
               <li><strong>Policymakers and government officials:</strong> They can use our visuals to identify areas that may require new policies or interventions to address crime.</li>
               <li><strong>Law enforcement agencies:</strong> Focus efforts on communities and states with higher crime rates to allocate resources more effectively.</li>
               <li><strong>Researchers studying criminology:</strong> Draw conclusions that help expand understanding and inform future studies on the relationship between crime and various demographics.</li>
               <li><strong>Real estate investors:</strong> Evaluate crime data as an additional factor in their decision-making process, helping determine whether to invest in certain properties or communities. This insight can ultimately guide their investments and contribute to more informed sales strategies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               <strong>The following visuals show some of the variables influencing crime rates among different communities in the US, such as population, racial demographics, and income.</strong>

                  <p>Figure 1 illustrates the population distribution across the 48 states for which we have data. As shown, California has the largest population, followed by Texas and New York. Based on this, we can reasonably infer that these states are likely to experience higher crime rates, simply due to their larger populations.</p>

This figure can be useful for individuals seeking a particular community or those interested in living in a more diverse state. Notably, the graph reveals that, in most states, the White population is the majority. However, the District of Columbia stands out as the only region with a predominantly Black population, making it unique in having a higher proportion of a race other than White.</p>

                  <p>Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of median income values across states, displaying key statistical measures for each state's median income. The chart includes the maximum and minimum, representing the highest and lowest median incomes across all states, as well as the upper and lower fences, which are statistical thresholds used to identify potential outliers. It also shows Quartile 1 (Q1) and Quartile 3 (Q3), which represent the 25th and 75th percentiles of median income values, highlighting the spread of the middle 50% of data, along with the median, which indicates the central value of the median incomes for each state. This graph provides a comprehensive view of how median incomes vary across states, offering insights into income distribution and the range of values within different communities across the states.</p>

                  <p>To make the data easier to understand, we created a choropleth map displaying the median income by state (Figure 4), which highlights that states with larger populations, like California and Texas (as seen in Figure 1), tend to have higher median incomes. Unlike the mean, the median income is not influenced by extreme outliers, providing a more accurate representation of the typical income most people earn.By examining this map, we can explore potential patterns between median income and crime rates across states. For instance, while New Jersey has a higher median income than Texas, despite its smaller population, this suggests that income alone doesn't fully explain the variation in crime rates. Although some correlations can be observed, it’s important to consider the demographic differences within each state, as they may play a significant role in influencing both income and crime levels.</p>
